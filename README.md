*Basic spigot plugin to manage a lobby*

I've done this plugin because I've been trying to look for basic hub plugins helps me out to make a hub. It only got many utilities that are simple.

**How do i install it?**  
- Put it into your plugins folder
- Restart your server in the which your lobby is
- Join into the game and configure it!

The plugin is currently in development, many caracteristics are planned like player settings
